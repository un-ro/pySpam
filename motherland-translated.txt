Indonesia, my fatherland
Land spill my blood
That’s where I stand
So my mom’s Guide
Indonesia, kebangsaanku
The nation and the homeland
Let us cry out
“Indonesia bersatu!”
Walk in mine own country, there lived tanahku
My people, my people, all of them
Wake up, wake up her soul
For Indonesia Raya
Indonesia Raya, merdeka, merdeka!
My, mine own country, which I love
Indonesia Raya, merdeka, merdeka!
Long Live Indonesia Raya
Indonesia Raya, merdeka, merdeka!
My, mine own country, which I love
Indonesia Raya, merdeka, merdeka!
Long Live Indonesia Raya
